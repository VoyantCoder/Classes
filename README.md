            This repository will offer individual classes that will eventually be implemented into the Clod Library. It is easier to test components this way and it is nice to have them in a separate repository anyways. Follow the progress as it comes along.

        <p>
            You will find mainly C# in here because that is the basis for the Framework. However you may find small pieces of C++, PHP, JavaScript, React, SQL, HTML and Python too, depending on the type of component. Each component will be made with the idea of it being of use to me in the future, so summaries will be in place too.
