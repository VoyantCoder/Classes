            I started working on this project because I feel like it is nice to have a class for dealing with generating READMEs, pages and more. This class will be a part of the upcoming Clod Library however, this is how I will be testing individual components from now on. The Library will more so be like a framework very soon with the high amounts of codes that will be going into it.
